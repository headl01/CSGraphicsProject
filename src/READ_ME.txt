To run this file, there exists a .exe file that can be ran from the
green arrow of the IDE (VS comminity 2026 in this case). A terminal 
window will pop up saying all assertions have passed. 

There is the case that the project hasn't been built locally so there 
may not be the correct drivers. Build all and it should run without an 
issue.
